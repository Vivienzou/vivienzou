#This is a program to compute the sin, cos and tan based on 2 given sides by users.
#the code is shown in file code, README.py

#Below is a examples:

f(3,4)

This is a program is working for Trig functions given by 2 sides a and b

The sin, cos and tan of alpha bounded by side b and c, in order, is

0.8 0.6 0.75

The sin, cos and tan of Beta bounded by side a and c, in order, is

0.6 0.8 1.33333333333333333333
